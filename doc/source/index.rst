GrapheneModeling
================

GrapheneModeling makes modeling graphene easy!

A large amount of literature has been written on graphene. The singular 
goal of GraphenemModeling is to compile the most important 
literature as executable code into one Python package for the use of 
the community.

Are you a research group looking to explain your experiment with 
theory?

Are you an early graduate student getting up to speed on graphene 
literature?
