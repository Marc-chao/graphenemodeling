GrapheneModeling
================

Graphene is one of the most heavily studied materials of the past two decades. A large amount of literature has been written on its properties and applications. Thousands of papers are published each year. As such, staying up-to-date on graphene literature is difficult, albeit necessary for the advancement of its study.

GrapheneModeling attempts to alleviate this difficulty by providing a centralized resource on models of graphene. We compile the most important literature on graphene's properties and maintain the results as executable Python code. All code is provided with examples that replicate a result found in the literature. In this way, we hope to reduce ramp-up time and errors for groups looking to model their experiments.
