GrapheneModeling
================

GrapheneModeling makes it easy to model graphene!

Graphene research has exploded in the past two decades. As such, a large amount of literature has been written from theoretical descriptions of its properties and some experimental verification. The singular goal of GraphenemModeling is to compile the most important literature as executable code into one Python package for the use of 
the community.

Are you a research group looking to explain your experiment with 
theory?

Are you an early graduate student getting up to speed on graphene 
literature?

Are you a software company looking to incorporate graphene models into your code?
