# Overview

This document assumes knowledge of the properties of graphene and derives their effects on the plasmons that graphene supports.

# Quantum Effects

## Edge States



## Scales

# Structured Graphene

Reflection from the edge of graphene causes a phase shift of roughly $0.35\pi$. Therefore, the wavelengths that fit in nanoribbon of width $W$ have a wavenumber $k$ that satisfies $2m\pi=2(0.35\pi)+2W\text{Re}[k]​$ ([Brar 2013](https://doi.org/10.1021/nl400601c)). This can modify the dispersion of modes on structured graphene.

## Hexagonal Boron-Nitride

[Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN)](../Boron-Nitride/Boron-Nitride.md#Phonons) has an optical phonon at 1370 cm$^{-1}​$. Graphene plasmons have been shown to hybridize with it and form two independent *surface-phonon-plasmon-polariton* modes [Brar 2014](https://doi.org/10.1021/nl501096s). This experiment was performed on monolayer hBN showing that it only couples to a small volume of hBN.
